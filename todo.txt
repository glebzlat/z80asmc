lexer.c:

    - Backtracking does not take into account a line number and a beginning
      of a line (bol). This leads to wrong line numbers on tokens.

parser.c:

    - Add a vector of errors and a vector of warnings. Parser does not panic
      on a first encountered error, but puts it into a vector and skips the
      line, continuing parsing. After the parsing is done, errors are formatted
      and printed.
